# Simple Local RAG System

This project demonstrates a basic Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system using locally hosted ollama llama3.2.
It utilizes llama for the Large Language Model (LLM), Nomic Embed Text for embeddings, ChromaDB for vector storage,
and LangChain for orchestration.

## Prerequisites
nomic-embed-text: latest
llama3.2
chromadb 1.0.3

Before running this system, ensure you have the following installed and configured:

* **Python 3.x:** Make sure you have Python installed.
* **Ollama:** Download and install Ollama from [https://ollama.ai/](https://ollama.ai/). (locally hosted)
Ensure your desired LLM model is pulled and running in Ollama. For example: `ollama pull llama2`



## Setup and Usage

1.  **Clone the Repository (If applicable):** If you have this code in a repository, clone it to your local machine.
2.  **Place your document:** Place the text document you want to query into the same directory as your RAG script.
3.  **Run the Python script:** Execute the Python script that implements the RAG pipeline.
